Finally, I find hosting a blog on github is pretty cool. I have tried some other blog hosting service. I just don't like them, as I did not get the code-level freedom. Customizing a blog site is sometimes a little bit inconvenient.

This a new start, I will write everything in which I am interested: maths, machine learning, functional programming, distributed system, [Spark](http://spark.apache.org/), etc.

I would like to thank the [Author](https://twitter.com/railsr7) of this beautiful [Theme](https://github.com/railsr/autm-rb). I have also modified a lot to satisfy my taste.

Frankly speaking, blogging in jekyll is much more simpler than I thought. It just gives the desire of writing.

As a non-native English speaker, I want to also improve my English by telling my journey of discovering the wonderful world.
